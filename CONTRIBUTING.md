## Contributing to IriusRisk-Central

Are you ready to contribute to the IriusRisk library? We welcome community contributions! Please don't hesitate to share your [Libraries](Libraries/README.md), [Templates](Templates/README.md) or [scripts](Integrations/README.md) for the benefit of the entire threat modeling community!

### The How of contributing

Contributing to the library can be done via the standard pull-request method. Here are the basic steps:
* Create a fork of the [IriusRisk-Central](README.md) library
* Clone that fork to your local machine
* Add your changes to the appropriate directory
* Commit those changes to your fork and push them to GitHub
* Create a pull-request against the IriusRisk-Central repository (**main** branch)

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about this process.

### Documentation

While we often spend a lot of time working on our time-savers, we typically tend to forget documenting. After all, we know what they do and their purpose intimately, having conceived and created them. Documenting what we already know doesn't seem as useful as the myriad improvements we might make to the tools.

Unfortunately, others don't have our insights into what we're doing, so may not see the purpose, let alone udnerstand the details. For this reason, it's important to carefully document everything we're providing to the community.

This takes different forms for the different artifacts. For external scripts (found in [Integrations](Integrations/README.md)), sound commenting according to the script language in question should suffice. For [Templates](Templates/README.md), typically a short description should suffice. Shapes are similar--just mentioning what they are and when to use them is typically enough.

For [Libraries](Libraries/README.md), especially complex ones, it might be advisable to include a more detailed description. This should include:
* What the library covers
* The sources for producing it
* Pertinent details (version, date, etc)
* Anything else a user needs to know

Consider adding a similarly-named markdown page to include such descriptions, in addition to descriptions within the library itself. So if you had a library titled **ACME Standards.xml**, considering creating the markdown file **ACME Standards.md** and include the detailed description there.

### Comments, questions or issues you might have

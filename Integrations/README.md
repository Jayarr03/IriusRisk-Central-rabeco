## Integrations
Here you will find anything extending IriusRisk functionality via its APIs. This can include report generation, automated creation or destruction of items, or two-way integrations with third-party tools. Python is a popular scripting language for this, though you may also find Postman scripts, JavaScript or others. 

## Contents
* [Report Generator](Report%20Generator/README.md): This generates a threat report for a product based on its components and associated threats and countermeasures using IriusRisk APIs.
* [OutputLibraryInfo](OutputLibraryInfo/README.md): This outputs the contents of all libraries in a given IriusRisk instance. (It also provides a good example of how to work with the [ApiShell](ApiShell/README.md) module.)
* [ApiShell](ApiShell/README.md): A program shell to aid calling IriusRisk APIs. Use it to create more complex scripts that create, call and process API calls.

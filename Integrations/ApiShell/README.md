## API Shell program

This is a program shell to aid calling IriusRisk APIs. Use this shell to 
create more complex scripts that create, call and process API calls.

Using this shell program provides default command-line and configuration-file
entries useful for making IriusRisk API calls. Most of the command line 
arguments provided can be duplicated in configuration files, thereby allowing
you to provide them in a file once across multiple script calls.

For further information, clone this subdirectory and execute the main file:

    python3 main.py

This will describe in detail how to call the program shell. Also see comments
in the main.py file for an example of how to use it.

### TODO
* Need to look for ini files in multiple locations
* Need to add a toolkit to ease HTTP calls

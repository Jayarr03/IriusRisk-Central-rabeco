Here you'll find various items to aid your IriusRisk journey. Each folder contains artifacts associated with a different area of IriusRisk implementation:
- *Integrations* represent anything automating IriusRisk externally, largely by accessing the API. This could include applications that both read and write to IriusRisk, or ones that link between IriusRisk and third-party applications
- *Libraries* are exactly that--libraries providing new risk patterns and components to be consumed and used within IriusRisk
- *Shapes* can be consumed by non-IriusRisk draw.io integrations, in order to create compatible designs.
- *Templates* includes commonly needed Project templates representing various architectures.

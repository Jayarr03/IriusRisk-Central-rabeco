Here you'll find various items to aid your IriusRisk journey. Each folder contains artifacts associated with a different area of IriusRisk implementation:
- *Integrations* represent anything automating IriusRisk externally. This could include:
  - Scripts that both read and write to IriusRisk
  - Ones that link between IriusRisk and third-party applications via APIs
  - Scripts that process raw data from IriusRisk for reporting
  - Scripts that process other data from IriusRisk (XML outputs, Excel sheets)
- *Libraries* are exactly that--libraries providing new risk patterns and components to be consumed and used within IriusRisk
  - For instance, this might include vendor-specific libraries, from Cisco, IBM or others
- *Shapes* can be consumed by non-IriusRisk draw.io integrations, in order to create compatible designs.
- *Templates* includes commonly needed Project templates representing various architectures
  - This includes common architecture diagrams acting as a starting point for more specific work
  - It also includes vendor-specific architectures, for instance from GPC or AWS
